Today we are exposed to the internet and it has become less necessary for us to memorize everything. We don’t try to absorb information like before because we don’t have to worry about losing information anymore. So for my project I want to criticize how the internet has become our primary external storage system. Maybe in the future, we no longer need to memorize anything since the internet does everything.

I am using a camera sensor to capture whatever I want to save or remember, and those photos will automatically upload to the web server that becomes a personal digital memory. 




**Tools used:**
- RaspberryPi 
- Camera sensor
- Arduino
- Photo Resistor
- LED





**How it works:**

When you see something that you want to remember, you can simply cover the photo sensor on the glove to activate a camera on the helmet. Once the photo is taken, all the photos will be saved locally in the folder in your raspberry pi and list it on the web server in real time.
